FAKE Server Network Environment Configuration Guide

Introduction to FAKE Server

A FAKE server is a specialized configuration used in network environments for managing communication between a server and a group of clients. It is specifically designed to implement the
FAKE protocol, facilitating interactions between the server and connected clients.

Configuring Network Settings
For setting up network parameters like IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways, standard CISCO commands are utilized.

Key Component: FAKE Server Pool
The essential element of a FAKE server is its FAKE Server Pool, which acts as a central hub containing the server, its properties, and the managed clients.

Managing the FAKE Server Pool
Creation: To create a new FAKE server pool, use the command: create fake_server_pool <FAKE_SERVER_POOL_NAME>
Deletion: To delete an existing FAKE server pool, use: delete fake_server_pool <FAKE_SERVER_POOL_NAME>
Access: To access a specific FAKE server pool, use: access fake_server_pool <FAKE_SERVER_POOL_NAME>

Note: Attempting to access a non-existent pool will result in an exception. The 'create' command also grants access if the pool already exists.

Adding the FAKE Server to the Pool
After defining or accessing the FAKE server pool, add the server's IP address using: add fake_server <SERVER_IP_ADDRESS>
This command initiates a network search (FK_SEND) for the server; if found, an acknowledgement (FK_ACK) is received, allowing further configuration.

Configuring FAKE Server Pool Settings
Number of FAKE Clients: Set the maximum number of connectable FAKE clients using: num_fakes <DEFINE_NUM_OF_FAKES>
Mirror Configuration: Include a FAKE mirror in the server for replicating behavior, configurable with: mirror <IP_ADDRESS_MIRROR>
Adding FAKE Clients: Introduce FAKE clients to the server's pool with: add fake_client <CLIENT_IP_ADDRESS>
Similar to the server, a network search (FKCL_SEND) locates the client; a successful find results in
an acknowledgement (FKCL_ACK) for continued configuration.

Example Configuration
For a FAKE server pool named MY_POOL with a maximum of 10 clients, the FAKE server IP address 192.168.1.1 /24, the mirror IP address 192.168.1.2 /24, and clients from 192.168.1.10 /24 to 192.168.1.15 /24, the configuration commands would be:

create fake_server_pool MY_POOL
add fake_server 192.168.1.1 /24
mirror 192.168.1.2 /24
num_fakes 10
add fake_client 192.168.1.110 /24
add fake_client 192.168.1.111 /24
add fake_client 192.168.1.112 /24
add fake_client 192.168.1.113 /24
add fake_client 192.168.1.114 /24
add fake_client 192.168.1.115 /24
